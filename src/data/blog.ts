          "There is growing awareness of suicide as a major public health problem, even though there is a taboo in many societies against discussing openly. Worldwide Suicide rates have increased by 60% over the last 50 years, and the increase has been particularly marked in developing countries. Suicide occurs all over the world and can take place at almost any age. <br /><br />Globally, suicide rates are highest in people aged 60 years and over. In some countries, however, the highest rates are found among the young. Notably, suicide is now among the three leading global causes of death among young people aged 15-34 years, the majority of suicides are reported in adults and older adults (60 years and older). <br /><br />Pesticide poisoning, hanging and firearms are among the most common methods of suicide globally.<br /><br />In Nigeria, Suicide is becoming a looming Public health problem and should be taken seriously.We remember popular cases that were reported of a man, a medical doctor who drove down to the third mainland bridge, parked his car, jumped into the lagoon, and died in 2019.<br /><br />-A young man identified as Kelvin committed suicide at Modinatu Street in the Ogba area of Lagos.<br />-The lifeless body of Kevin who works with a new generation bank was found dangling from a ceiling fan, in his apartment by neighbors.<br />-Young Nigerian, creative designer and founder of Uhuru Designz, the United States of America-based clothing company, Izuchukwu Madubueze reportedly committed suicide Over Fake Rape Allegations that took place on Twitter in July 2020. He even announced his own death on twitter before his death.Sadly as we know these are not all the cases and some have not been covered by the media. <br /><br />Suicides are Preventable!<br /><br />“No matter where a country currently stands in suicide prevention”, said Dr Alexandra Fleischmann, Scientist in the Department of Mental Health and Substance Abuse at WHO, “effective measures can be taken, even just starting at local level and on a small-scale”<br /><br /><ol><li>Always Check up on friends and family.</li><li>Encouraging friends and families to always take mental health seriously and to see a counselor when it’s necessary.</li><li>Responsible reporting of suicide in the media, such as avoiding language that sensationalizes suicide and avoiding explicit description of methods used, and early identification and management of mental and substance use disorders in communities and by health workers in particular</li>.<li>Social media has come to stay and some people are living fake lives. Don’t compare your life with others because you don’t know what they are going through and you may just be better off than them.</li><li>Follow-up care by health workers through regular contact, including by phone or home visits, for people who have attempted suicide, together with provision of community support, are essential, because people who have already attempted suicide are at the greatest risk of trying again.</li><li>Regular exercise, improve healthy lifestyle.</li><li>Reducing access to means of suicide is one way to reduce deaths.</li></ol> <br /><br />Below is a few list of some Mental health Organizations we have:<br /><br /><ul><li>African Mental Health Awareness & Care Initiative, Maiduguri</li><li>Mental Health Foundation, Nigeria</li><li>Gede Foundation, Abuja </li><li>UNIC Ikoyi</ul> <br /> <br /> Source: WHO, Vanguard <br /><br />  Article written by Sheba Asuquo",

          "‘The icing on the cake”…Wavecrest College of Hospitality Partners with Fly Africa Initiative to break Guinness World Record 2020",
        postsText:
          "Featuring in the <em>Guinness World Records</em> is obviously not a yearly event. This is why Wavecrest College was excited to be a part of an amazing project partnering with the Fly Africa Initiative to make an official attempt to break the Guinness World Record to make the largest cupcake mosaic logo of 60,000 cupcakes to celebrate Nigeria’s 60th Independence Anniversary in Lagos.<br /><br />For those who may not know, Fly Africa is an initiative of Outori Limited created to inspire and educate Africans through live experiences, to rise up to their great potentials by taking actions that will move the African continent forward. Mr. Wole Olagundoye the Managing Director of Outori and the brain behind the ‘Sweet 60’ project visited Wavecrest College with his Team to conclude plans and logistics on how the tail end of the project will be executed. This last lap was indeed very crucial and needed to be handled by professionals and like minds who saw the vision of the project through his own eyes. <br /><br />Choosing Wavecrest College; the place to <em>‘Discover Hospitality’ </em>to partner in the project was indeed the best decision. Wavecrest College is the First Private Monotechnic in Nigeria specialising in Hospitality careers, with over 40 years of hospitality experience built on our solid core values of Teamwork, Respect for others, Industriousness, Personal responsibility, Integrity and Spirit of service.<br /><br />The role of Wavecrest was mind-blowing – to prepare the butter icing, roll and cut out fondant icing of different colours needed to cover 60,000 cupcakes. 60,000 not 6,000! This indeed was a challenge for us but knowing the goal, we were ready to go any length in order to make it happen.<br /><br />The College became a factory overnight with all hands on deck from the usual catering staff, to our students who joyfully volunteered. Even the Provost had her own quota of fondants to cut. It was another opportunity to witness our values come alive in real time as every member of staff took up the project like it was their personal business. It took 4 days working round the clock, swimming in shades of green, grey and white fondant, kneading and cutting 3 inches each of fondant, no more no less.<br /><br /> <em>‘Thank you for everything your team did to make this historical event a success. Your warm hospitality was second to none, your team members were awesome and dedicated and I am indeed proud to be associated with you.’</em> This feedback from one of the Project Coordinators says it all!<br/><br/> At about 11 p.m. Wednesday night – 30th September, 2020 -, the gigantic-sized cooling van containing the last batch of meticulously labelled cake boxes especially those for the shimmering diamond design in the centre of the logo left Wavecrest College premises to Teslim Balogun Stadium. At that point, we could heave a sigh of relief because we knew we had achieved.<br/><br/> Wavecrest was part of ‘the icing on the cake’ the beauty that met the eye, for the ‘Sweet 60’ project, the Guinness world record breaking mosaic representing the beautiful and breath-taking 60th Anniversary logo of Nigeria’s 60th independence anniversary. <br/><br/>We would like to appreciate Mr. Wole Olagundoye for giving Wavecrest College the opportunity to be a major part of the project and the penultimate site for the last lap of preparations. A man who can embark on a project like this in spite of the challenges of 2020 is obviously a person to reckon with. His resilience drive and optimism are second to none. Fly Africa has certainly lived up to its aim of showcasing African talent and solidarity as all parties involved played their role excellently well. The major sponsors and collaborators – Lagos State Government, Dangote Sugar, Graceco Foods -Baker’s Choice and Golden Penny could not have been more supportive.<br/><br/>The other partners were a pleasure to work with here at Wavecrest College – Atinuke Soje of Nukkies Boutique cakes, Mr. Ajayi of U & I cakes, Mrs. Toyin Naiwo of EventsPedia and indeed all the amazing volunteers. With this display of team spirit, we are very hopeful that our dear country Nigeria has a brighter future. <br /><br />‘Cheers to Sweet 60’. <br /><br />Baptista Uwandu Wavecrest College Marketing Personnel, Mrs. Toyin Naiwo EventsPedia, Mrs. Helen Eboigbe <br /> – Wavecrest College Development Committee.",

These people effectively represent the interests of the trade or industry concerned, to which the particular NSQ relates. Sector Bodies define what the job entails. For government led sector skills council, the composition should be 70 % industry/ employers and 30% trade unions, professional associations, academia etc.<br /><br /> <b>Awarding bodies:</b> design assessment and quality assurance systems, and gain sector bodies endorsement prior to submission to NBTE for accreditation of the qualification. Awarding bodies approve training and assessment centres to offer NSQs. implement and assure quality of the NSQs . Awarding Bodies are basically the top-level training certification organisations (the ones whose names and logos are on the certificates). They don’t deliver the training, they design the structures of the qualifications and accredit the certification, which the training organisations and Assessment Centres use and deliver.<br /><br /> Awarding Bodies engage with client organisations if they are large enough to have their own NSQ training and delivery departments. Awarding bodies engage with Sector Bodies and training organisations. Training organisations are effectively distributors of the Awarding Bodies’ qualifications systems.<br /><br /> They undertake external verification to ensure that candidates are being assessed fairly and consistently across all centres.<br /><br /><b> Regulatory Body: NBTE</b> accredits proposals for qualifications submitted by awarding bodies, and monitors Awarding bodies offering NSQs. NBTE effectively manages the whole system on behalf of the Government. <br /><br /> <b>Assessment centres:</b> assess NSQs according to Awarding body criteria.<br /><br /><b>Training providers: </b> deliver NSQ training in partnership with the industry, register candidates, assess and guide candidates towards achieving NSQs.",

At the operational level, intensive hygiene concepts and process redesigns for a successful reopening are being implemented and questions are being asked about when everything will return to ‘normal’.</em> <br /><br /> <b> Bright Spots but Far from Stable.</b><br /><br /> However, people in the hospitality industry are slowly becoming aware that the scale of this crisis is so drastic that the future has already changed direction. <b>Thus, for the hotel industry, it is now a matter of making a fresh start and integrating socio-economic challenges into their own business model. </b><br />The first bright spots are slowly emerging in the travel market. However, it will still take some time to stabilize. Thanks to improving numbers of infections and the enormous importance of tourism for the national economies, hotels in most European countries are already open again. <br /><br />With the reopening of the hotel and travel markets, it is now up to hoteliers to cope with the effects of the crisis.<br /><br /> <b> Many Questions Arise</b> <br /><br /> Hotel operators are facing a challenge of whether the reopening will pay off at all. If so, exactly when and under what legal conditions, without losing any more money? Can the lease be paid again?<br /><br /> Investors and asset managers, in turn, worry about the tenants securing cash flows and the commitments and promises made to investors. Active buyers are wondering which markets, segments and concepts are the fastest to emerge from the crisis mode and offer opportunities for increasing value.<br /><br /> <b>Localization of a Globalized World.</b><br /><br /> A trend that is already emerging is the localization of a globalized world. The hotel industry recovery can benefit from local productions booming and networks being localized.<b>In the future, the viability of the business relationship between landlord, tenant, lender and borrower, client and customer will be put to the test.</b>  Hotel owners, operators and banks have to secure values and be warry of the sustainability of business models.<br /><br /> The world as we know it is currently dissolving, at least in some areas. At the same time, however, there are new long-term perspectives. In addition to financial aid and fair burden-sharing, it is now a matter of developing business models with the involvement of all stakeholders. Unilateral solutions at the expense of a partner will quickly lead to major problems in the next few years.",

          "Having a small party at home is also an opportunity to display your entertainment skills. Since the meal is the main focus of the entire celebration, you should choose a table centerpiece that will really impress your guests but you don’t have to break the bank to get it done. Here are some creative ideas for a stylish centerpiece.<br /><br /><ol> <li>Candles: Place a large candle in a glass container surrounded by stones and shells.  Nothing makes a table look more elegant than soft, glowing candles.</li><img src='../assets/imgs/blog-candle.jpeg' alt='candles' /> <br /><br /><li>Lemons, limes, and oranges add bright pops of color to a table without breaking the budget. Stack them in tall, narrow vases or fill round, wide bowls with them. </li><br /><br /><li>Wine Bottles: Take a few bottles from your previous party and remove the labels. Then fill them with thin branches of flowers and tie them with a rope or ribbons. These types of arrangements work really well at picnics and outdoor gatherings.</li></ol>",

          "<em>Veronica Esode</em><br /><em> Registrar </em><br /><em>Wavecrest College of Hospitality </em> <br /><br />In the world today, the exponential growth rate of graduate unemployment has become a serious cause of anxiety. It is a challenge that most economies are facing under the current economic circumstances (Oppong & Sachs, 2015). <br /><br />More so, with the advent of COVID-19, the world we have always known is not just rapidly changing, NO! In fact, we can hardly recognize it, and yet we must survive and thrive with whatever we can lay our hands-on. <br /><br />Some very well-known causes of unemployment in Nigeria include an excessive supply of university graduates as compared with available job opportunities, insufficient hands-on and practical training to match job requirements, and a non-existent curriculum for training in Life Skills which is of utmost importance for survival and thriving in the work environment.<br /> <a href =' https://www.nepad.org/skillsportalforyouth/good-practice/depth-hospitality-and-life-skills-training-guarantees-girl-child. '> https://www.nepad.org/skillsportalforyouth/good-practice/depth-hospitality-and-life-skills-training-guarantees-girl-child. </a> <br /><br />The figures from JAMB 2019 Admissions speaks volumes. For all courses apart from Education and Agriculture, applicants are at least 3 times more than the available spaces in Higher Institutions. In the case of Medicine and Law, they are up to 15 times more than the available spaces.<br /><br />However, for Polytechnics and Monotechnics who have a quota of 17, 574, only 4,982 were admitted. That is 72%  of spaces are waiting to be filled. This may be due to the widespread notion that the University Degree is superior to the Diplomas from other Higher Institutions. It could also be due to the fact of the poor standards of some Institutions. Nevertheless, times have changed and we need to look forward and ahead.<br /><br /> Conrad Burns said ‘Vocational education programs have made a real difference in the lives of countless young people nationwide; they build self-confidence and leadership skills by allowing students to utilize their unique gifts and talents’.<br /><br /> The Nigerian government is doing its bit to establish policies and strategies to salvage the situation. Technical and Vocational Training (TVET) System <a href='https://unevoc.unesco.org/wtdb/worldtvetdatabase_nga_en.pdf'>https://unevoc.unesco.org/wtdb/worldtvetdatabase_nga_en.pdf</a> and the National Skills Qualification Framework (NSQF) for example aim to assist the federal and state education authorities in their effort to revitalize, reform and expand the provision of skills, vocations, science, and technology to meet the nation’s present and future socio-economic needs.<br /><br /> Nevertheless, as individuals, we need to wake up to the reality on the ground. Vocational training and Technical skills are extremely pertinent today. Truth be told,  the professional courses are needed – we always need Doctors, Engineers, and Lawyers but as we see from the JAMB statistics, these courses are highly saturated on the level of admissions and much more so on the level of employment. After the struggle to gain admission, getting a job is even more difficult. <br /><br />Why do we keep complicating our lives when there are other options and possibilities, lucrative and mind-blowing career paths that Nigerian youths can follow? Many applicants are still out there seeking admission into ‘professional’ courses. This mentality among Parents, Guardians, and the Applicants themselves needs to be transformed and enlightened if the scourge of unemployment is to be eradicated. ",

          "<b>Education:</b> I have been a lover of good and wholesome meals before I attended Wavecrest College. But Wavecrest took my brain, my ideas about food and hospitality, and in fact my whole body system back to factory settings. In a few words, I have gained basic and standard knowledge about good cooking skills and accurate measurement in the kitchen, personal hygiene, professional ethics, and morals. <br /><br /><b>Empowerment:</b> I have been empowered with a heart of a lioness to break limits and do exploits, to stand out and be unapologetically independent. I now have self-confidence, honesty, truth, and godly morals.<br /><br /><b>Employment: </b> I have employed myself full-time. I am into cooking, serving, and educating others at UCHYFIDE CULINARY. It didn’t come that easy, with much work, dedication, and most importantly with the help of God Almighty, I am a full-time staff and manager of Uchyfide CULINARY. I AM BREAKING LIMITS. THANK YOU WAVECREST COLLEGE OF HOSPITALITY.",

          "Heyyy!!!<br /> <br /> Who screamed? My house! The windows, the nets, the doors, and the floors everything is screaming…why? They have never experienced such ‘squeaky clean’ scrubbing ever. Everywhere … What is happening? For the past 3 weeks everyone has been at home. Something in town…Corona Virus! Run! <br /><br /> The sink: <em>‘I am constantly wet’.</em> (Everyone is washing their hands). I can see one person about 15 times in a day. My assistant (liquid soap) does not last anymore for up to 2 days.<br /><br /> The Mirror: I am not lacking faces anymore. (Those washing their hands have been admiring themselves)<br /><br /> The Door: The elbow has become my new love. (Everyone tries to open with the elbow.) <br /><br />The floor: I get to be swept and scrubbed daily. My new perfume is bleach! <br /><br />My dear students, <br /><br />The situation we find ourselves in, has been highly unprecedented. We are shocked, the whole world has been taken unawares. And we find that in such situations, we don’t know how to react. There are many ways one can react: ‘fear, learn or grow…’ <br /><br /> We have chosen to act, we want to… <br /><br />At this period too, the fear of the effects of the pandemic, including reduced supply of our basic needs for the day make it more worrisome.  <br /><br />But what do we do? Where do we go from here?<br /><br /> It is very tough for you and for most of us. And now, we need to do our classes online! Technology use comes with its varying challenges: not having adequate mobile devices to download the appropriate app, insufficient power supply with reduced battery power of our devices, and the increasing cost of data! Name it!….<br /><br /> Can we make the most of our situation? We decided at the point of the lockdown that we would start classes online if ‘stay home’ continues. We agreed to use the most accessible means for many of us for classroom teaching and learning. However, as the day goes by we realise that the challenges get rougher. And we don’t know, what can we do?<br /><br /> While we work and pray for the best…Do you know you can save your data and your battery life? Here are a few tricks I use:<br /><br /> Keep a timetable and keep busy in the house. Have time to clean, study, be on the phone, watch movie, go to bed etc. When you engage in many activities, you would not be ‘hooked’ on your phone.Switch off phones when not in use for a long time. For example when going to bed. <br /><br /><ul><li>Put your phone settings so that it does not automatically download media. You download the ones you believe are of interest to you. As you know, your contacts send many things on Whatsapp and some are repeated in groups.</li><li> Set your Whatsapp messages to ‘silent’, your phone will not beep all the time message comes in.</li><li> Switch on your data at a fixed time when you plan to be online or to check and reply messages.</li><li> If you are working with a laptop, try to work offline most of the time and then copy and paste your work when you are ready to reply or send email for example. Switch off apps that run or update automatically once you are connected to internet.</li><li> You may want to exit from Whatsapp groups that do not add much value to you. Evade clicking on all messages on the group especially if you are aware that the sender usually sends unimportant messages. </li><li>Limit sending videos and making video calls. Use messages to fix appointment for when you want to call or to be called.</li><li> Plan your social media presence especially on Facebook.<b>Must I like all selfie photos… </b> NO! </ul><br /> <br /> Back to our letter… <br /> <br /> What can I learn today outside school work? I won’t go to bed unless I learn something ‘new’…’ Let’s grow on the inside…’ like St. Josemaria advises. ‘If I make it out of this period what account do I give to myself, to others and God of making use of the talents I have…’ Creativity, initiative within the limits of the so little I have left…. This is part of Hospitality… remember…Wavecrest! …Discover Hospitality… <br />What can I do for someone today? <br /><br /><em> ‘I will pray and see how…’ </em>Yes, that’s the spirit… <br /><br />We can …God help us! 😀 <br /><br /> Nwabachili, 16-04-2020 <br /><br />p.s. I plan to learn to use the lawnmower today as the gardener has not been at work, and the grass is almost seeming like short trees.  I am afraid ‘creepy crawly’ may soon become a friend to the compound! I would see if I send you a photo when I start using it.",
