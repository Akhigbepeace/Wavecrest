      "My name is Chinonyerem Favour, am 20 years of age. At the time I finished secondary school I couldn't get into University because I wasn't old enough so I spent one year here and there doing nothing of great importance before I took my (JAMB) – This is a National exam everyone who intends to go the University takes in Nigeria and in my opinion is really not a true test of one’s knowledge as there are several hitches one may encounter in writing this exam especially when it became a computer based exam. I took my JAMB exam twice seeking to get into a desired University for a desired course but I wasn't fortunate enough because I did not make the cut-off mark for the course. This meant that I already ‘wasted’ two years trying to get into University.After the second trial, I decided to give my true passion a chance to come alive! The truth is I have always been a lover of the fields in Hospitality especially that of culinary arts and event planning. However, in the part of the world I live, hospitality is not given enough credit for several reasons. Parents prefer their children doing more ‘prestigious’ courses like Law, Engineering and Medicine. This is true especially for children who are brilliant and brainy and unfortunately even for those who are not – there is this ‘class’ thing in the minds of parents.For me, it was not easy at first to convince my parents and the teachers in my life to allow me pursue a career in Hospitality because I was considered a brilliant and brainy student in Secondary School. But I gave it a try and succeeded. When I finally started this journey, I realized how much time I had wasted before pursuing my true dreams.  3 years after Secondary School was when I managed to convince my parents amidst different bad reviews from people telling me I was going to waste my knowledge if I pursued Hospitality courses. This time I did not bother listening to them and I set out to find the best hospitality school so I would not give anyone any opportunity to mock me later if I did not get the best. I did a Google search for the best hospitality schools in the State where I lived and I wrote down the 10 best that I saw. I started going to each of them one by one to make enquiries in person and see what they had to offer. Wavecrest was the 4th and last school I visited.",

      "My Name is Udodirim Peace and I am 28 years old. Before I came to Wavecrest I was working in a catering establishment, where I discovered my interest in hospitality, I was good with my work but I was earning very little because I had no formal training or any qualification. I had met graduates of the College and I admired them a lot. In fact, they lit the fire of Education and Excellence that kept burning in me till date. My dream was to graduate and build my career in hospitality (Room Division/ Customer Relation) and it still is. Finances have been my major challenge. But I am strongly determined to achieve my dreams. I have learnt a lot with subjects like Culinary, Research, Communication, Presentation, Simple accounting and entrepreneurial skills, Customer service where we had both theoretical and practical classes.With my training at the College, I have taught a friend of mine cake making and helped one of my classmates to improve her yoghurt making. I have also taught school girls skills on baking and cooking with proper recipes, it was a club called Home makers club at Gbaja Girls Junior Secondary School, Surulere, Lagos. Every Wednesday, Myself and the group did this for about 3 years. It helped me appreciate the fact that knowledge which is not passed on is a waste. I did my internship at Installations Limited Interior Designs and Decorations working as a Front Desk Associate and after my One-Year Internship, I was retained as a part-time staff in the Organization working on weekends and getting income to support my fees and daily upkeep at the College. My mentor  and former boss has helped me to discover my potential and my most dominating skill, yes! We worked together for 4 years even while I was schooling. Her mentorship has been nothing but a blessing. I assure you that Wavecrest is an Institution you can trust. Wavecrest has the best interest of their students at heart and will do so much to see that the students graduate.I graduated from the College last year with a Higher National Diploma in Hospitality Management. I am currently on Swiss scholarship to study in Boma International Hospitality College, Kenya. I decided to apply as a result of my interest to grow further in my hospitality career. Fortunately, I was selected among the many other students who applied.  I'm grateful to God for this great opportunity to experience different things in my career and other aspects of my life in general.Here in Boma International Hospitality College, I am doing a Certificate course  in Hospitality Operations which is mainly based on practical classes. This has really helped me in improving my skills acquired in Wavecrest College. Boma International Hospitality College is like the best thing that has happened to my career. My course consists of two (2) terms or semesters which last for about 13 weeks in each term. We study for 4 weeks and then take the first Continuous Assessment Test (CAT) and the second CAT in the 9th week and finally the end of term examinations takes place in the 13th week. The college timetable is quite flexible and yet loaded with valuable lessons. Boma International Hospitality College focuses solely on the main courses that the students require to do exploit in the industry after they graduate and get jobs. Besides, they teach according to the current trends in the hospitality industry. In other words, they do not only  rely on basic operational standards of teaching but they constantly adjust their teaching system to include what the students will meet in the industry and the school has given me the opportunity to consistently practice these skills which are  needed for me in the industry. Moreover, I have learnt both in practical and theoretical situations analysis and critical thinking, food production, food and beverage cost control and even Property Management System (PMS) for Room Division and Front Office with the software Opera PMS. In a nutshell, my experience in Boma International Hospitality College has been nothing but fulfilling. I feel like I have finally arrived and I can't wait to put everything I have learnt into practice. My dreams have not changed  but rather have been improved because of Wavecrest College and the exposure it has given me. My main focus is to grow in the industry to the highest possible position available for people as prepared and ready as I am. My appreciation to everybody and every institution that made this journey possible cannot be contained in this report, because it is too long and heavily loaded. Permit me to write a different report for it because my heart is filled with gratitude to Wavecrest College, The Swiss Government and Boma International Hospitality College.",

      "Meet Dyah Thelma an ND 1 student at Wavecrest, she has always had a passion for cooking. Hospitality has always been a family dream. Thelma discovered her passion for hospitality at a very tender age because her father, who is into the hospitality business, has always carried them along when they were little.Most of the time, she finds herself in the kitchen and sees cooking as a channel to express her emotions, energy, creativity and all.Thelma wanted to learn more about being creative in cooking and she needed the right school to put her through so she applied to Wavecrest college of Hospitality. Her dream is to reach out to people with her tasty meals and be a boss of her own. With the Hospitality education from Wavecrest college, Thelma’s dreams are gradually becoming a reality. “ At Wavecrest, I gained so many skills, food making is number one, then deep cleaning as opposed to regular cleaning, laundry etc. Wavecrest is a home to me, I am really happy to be here”, She said. For over 45 years and still counting, Wavecrest college has been helping young ladies to achieve their hospitality dream.",

Worldwide Suicide rates have increased by 60% over the last 50 years, and the increase has been particularly marked in developing countries. Suicide occurs all over the world and can take place at almost any age. <br /><br />Globally, suicide rates are highest in people aged 60 years and over. In some countries, however, the highest rates are found among the young. Notably, suicide is now among the three leading global causes of death among young people aged 15-34 years, the majority of suicides are reported in adults and older adults (60 years and older). <br /><br />Pesticide poisoning, hanging and firearms are among the most common methods of suicide globally.<br /><br />In Nigeria, Suicide is becoming a looming Public health problem and should be taken seriously.We remember popular cases that were reported of a man, a medical doctor who drove down to the third mainland bridge, parked his car, jumped into the lagoon, and died in 2019.<br /><br />-A young man identified as Kelvin committed suicide at Modinatu Street in the Ogba area of Lagos.<br />-The lifeless body of Kevin who works with a new generation bank was found dangling from a ceiling fan, in his apartment by neighbors.<br />-Young Nigerian, creative designer and founder of Uhuru Designz, the United States of America-based clothing company, Izuchukwu Madubueze reportedly committed suicide Over Fake Rape Allegations that took place on Twitter in July 2020.

          "‘The icing on the cake”…Wavecrest College of Hospitality Partners with Fly Africa Initiative to break Guinness World Record 2020",
        postsText:
          "Featuring in the <em>Guinness World Records</em> is obviously not a yearly event. This is why Wavecrest College was excited to be a part of an amazing project partnering with the Fly Africa Initiative to make an official attempt to break the Guinness World Record to make the largest cupcake mosaic logo of 60,000 cupcakes to celebrate Nigeria’s 60th Independence Anniversary in Lagos.<br /><br />For those who may not know, Fly Africa is an initiative of Outori Limited created to inspire and educate Africans through live experiences, to rise up to their great potentials by taking actions that will move the African continent forward. Mr. Wole Olagundoye the Managing Director of Outori and the brain behind the ‘Sweet 60’ project visited Wavecrest College with his Team to conclude plans and logistics on how the tail end of the project will be executed. This last lap was indeed very crucial and needed to be handled by professionals and like minds who saw the vision of the project through his own eyes. <br /><br />Choosing Wavecrest College; the place to <em>‘Discover Hospitality’ </em>to partner in the project was indeed the best decision. Wavecrest College is the First Private Monotechnic in Nigeria specialising in Hospitality careers, with over 40 years of hospitality experience built on our solid core values of Teamwork, Respect for others, Industriousness, Personal responsibility, Integrity and Spirit of service.<br /><br />The role of Wavecrest was mind-blowing – to prepare the butter icing, roll and cut out fondant icing of different colours needed to cover 60,000 cupcakes. 60,000 not 6,000! This indeed was a challenge for us but knowing the goal, we were ready to go any length in order to make it happen.<br /><br />The College became a factory overnight with all hands on deck from the usual catering staff, to our students who joyfully volunteered. Even the Provost had her own quota of fondants to cut. It was another opportunity to witness our values come alive in real time as every member of staff took up the project like it was their personal business. It took 4 days working round the clock, swimming in shades of green, grey and white fondant, kneading and cutting 3 inches each of fondant, no more no less.<br /><br /> <em>‘Thank you for everything your team did to make this historical event a success. Your warm hospitality was second to none, your team members were awesome and dedicated and I am indeed proud to be associated with you.’</em> This feedback from one of the Project Coordinators says it all!<br/><br/> At about 11 p.m. Wednesday night – 30th September, 2020 -, the gigantic-sized cooling van containing the last batch of meticulously labelled cake boxes especially those for the shimmering diamond design in the centre of the logo left Wavecrest College premises to Teslim Balogun Stadium. At that point, we could heave a sigh of relief because we knew we had achieved.<br/><br/> Wavecrest was part of ‘the icing on the cake’ the beauty that met the eye, for the ‘Sweet 60’ project, the Guinness world record breaking mosaic representing the beautiful and breath-taking 60th Anniversary logo of Nigeria’s 60th independence anniversary. <br/><br/>We would like to appreciate Mr. Wole Olagundoye for giving Wavecrest College the opportunity to be a major part of the project and the penultimate site for the last lap of preparations. A man who can embark on a project like this in spite of the challenges of 2020 is obviously a person to reckon with. His resilience drive and optimism are second to none. Fly Africa has certainly lived up to its aim of showcasing African talent and solidarity as all parties involved played their role excellently well. The major sponsors and collaborators – Lagos State Government, Dangote Sugar, Graceco Foods -Baker’s Choice and Golden Penny could not have been more supportive.<br/><br/>The other partners were a pleasure to work with here at Wavecrest College – Atinuke Soje of Nukkies Boutique cakes, Mr. Ajayi of U & I cakes, Mrs. Toyin Naiwo of EventsPedia and indeed all the amazing volunteers. With this display of team spirit, we are very hopeful that our dear country Nigeria has a brighter future. <br /><br />‘Cheers to Sweet 60’. <br /><br />Baptista Uwandu Wavecrest College Marketing Personnel, Mrs. Toyin Naiwo EventsPedia, Mrs. Helen Eboigbe <br /> – Wavecrest College Development Committee.",

Add about 5 leaves of shredded utazi and some water. Taste and correct seasoning. Cook for another 5-8 minutes until fish is well cooked. Take off the heat. Serve your Catfish pepper soup with boiled yam, plantain, rice, agidi (eko, corn paste pudding) etc. NOTE: You can use less scotch bonnet and add a little Cameroon pepper, it tastes really good. Instead of the different spices used here, you can simply use store-bought Pepper soup spice mix or any mixture of spices you like.",

          "<b>Written by Alec Hills; Article from</b> <a href='https://www.tourism-review.com/.'>https://www.tourism-review.com/. </a> <br /><br /> <em>After the drop in demand and the massive loss of control in the past months, the hotel industry is longing for the end of the Coronavirus pandemic. At the operational level, intensive hygiene concepts and process redesigns for a successful reopening are being implemented and questions are being asked about when everything will return to ‘normal’.</em> <br /><br /> <b> Bright Spots but Far from Stable.</b><br /><br /> However, people in the hospitality industry are slowly becoming aware that the scale of this crisis is so drastic that the future has already changed direction. <b>Thus, for the hotel industry, it is now a matter of making a fresh start and integrating socio-economic challenges into their own business model. </b><br />The first bright spots are slowly emerging in the travel market. However, it will still take some time to stabilize. Thanks to improving numbers of infections and the enormous importance of tourism for the national economies, hotels in most European countries are already open again. <br /><br />With the reopening of the hotel and travel markets, it is now up to hoteliers to cope with the effects of the crisis.<br /><br /> <b> Many Questions Arise</b> <br /><br /> Hotel operators are facing a challenge of whether the reopening will pay off at all. If so, exactly when and under what legal conditions, without losing any more money? Can the lease be paid again?<br /><br /> Investors and asset managers, in turn, worry about the tenants securing cash flows and the commitments and promises made to investors. Active buyers are wondering which markets, segments and concepts are the fastest to emerge from the crisis mode and offer opportunities for increasing value.<br /><br /> <b>Localization of a Globalized World.</b><br /><br /> A trend that is already emerging is the localization of a globalized world. The hotel industry recovery can benefit from local productions booming and networks being localized.<b>In the future, the viability of the business relationship between landlord, tenant, lender and borrower, client and customer will be put to the test.</b>  Hotel owners, operators and banks have to secure values and be warry of the sustainability of business models.<br /><br /> The world as we know it is currently dissolving, at least in some areas. At the same time, however, there are new long-term perspectives. In addition to financial aid and fair burden-sharing, it is now a matter of developing business models with the involvement of all stakeholders. Unilateral solutions at the expense of a partner will quickly lead to major problems in the next few years.",

Stack them in tall, narrow vases or fill round, wide bowls with them. </li><br /><br /><li>Wine Bottles: Take a few bottles from your previous party and remove the labels.

        postsText:
          "<em>Veronica Esode</em><br /><em> Registrar </em><br /><em>Wavecrest College of Hospitality </em> <br /><br />In the world today, the exponential growth rate of graduate unemployment has become a serious cause of anxiety. It is a challenge that most economies are facing under the current economic circumstances (Oppong & Sachs, 2015). <br /><br />More so, with the advent of COVID-19, the world we have always known is not just rapidly changing, NO! In fact, we can hardly recognize it, and yet we must survive and thrive with whatever we can lay our hands-on. <br /><br />Some very well-known causes of unemployment in Nigeria include an excessive supply of university graduates as compared with available job opportunities, insufficient hands-on and practical training to match job requirements, and a non-existent curriculum for training in Life Skills which is of utmost importance for survival and thriving in the work environment.<br /> <a href =' https://www.nepad.org/skillsportalforyouth/good-practice/depth-hospitality-and-life-skills-training-guarantees-girl-child. '> https://www.nepad.org/skillsportalforyouth/good-practice/depth-hospitality-and-life-skills-training-guarantees-girl-child. </a> <br /><br />The figures from JAMB 2019 Admissions speaks volumes. For all courses apart from Education and Agriculture, applicants are at least 3 times more than the available spaces in Higher Institutions. In the case of Medicine and Law, they are up to 15 times more than the available spaces.<br /><br />However, for Polytechnics and Monotechnics who have a quota of 17, 574, only 4,982 were admitted. That is 72%  of spaces are waiting to be filled. This may be due to the widespread notion that the University Degree is superior to the Diplomas from other Higher Institutions. It could also be due to the fact of the poor standards of some Institutions. Nevertheless, times have changed and we need to look forward and ahead.<br /><br /> Conrad Burns said ‘Vocational education programs have made a real difference in the lives of countless young people nationwide; they build self-confidence and leadership skills by allowing students to utilize their unique gifts and talents’.<br /><br /> The Nigerian government is doing its bit to establish policies and strategies to salvage the situation. Technical and Vocational Training (TVET) System <a href='https://unevoc.unesco.org/wtdb/worldtvetdatabase_nga_en.pdf'>https://unevoc.unesco.org/wtdb/worldtvetdatabase_nga_en.pdf</a> and the National Skills Qualification Framework (NSQF) for example aim to assist the federal and state education authorities in their effort to revitalize, reform and expand the provision of skills, vocations, science, and technology to meet the nation’s present and future socio-economic needs.<br /><br /> Nevertheless, as individuals, we need to wake up to the reality on the ground. Vocational training and Technical skills are extremely pertinent today. Truth be told,  the professional courses are needed – we always need Doctors, Engineers, and Lawyers but as we see from the JAMB statistics, these courses are highly saturated on the level of admissions and much more so on the level of employment. After the struggle to gain admission, getting a job is even more difficult. <br /><br />Why do we keep complicating our lives when there are other options and possibilities, lucrative and mind-blowing career paths that Nigerian youths can follow? Many applicants are still out there seeking admission into ‘professional’ courses. This mentality among Parents, Guardians, and the Applicants themselves needs to be transformed and enlightened if the scourge of unemployment is to be eradicated. ",

In a few words, I have gained basic and standard knowledge about good cooking skills and accurate measurement in the kitchen, personal hygiene, professional ethics, and morals. <br /><br /><b>Empowerment:</b> I have been empowered with a heart of a lioness to break limits and do exploits, to stand out and be unapologetically independent. I now have self-confidence, honesty, truth, and godly morals.<br /><br /><b>Employment: </b> I have employed myself full-time. I am into cooking, serving, and educating others at UCHYFIDE CULINARY.

          "Heyyy!!!<br /> <br /> Who screamed? My house! The windows, the nets, the doors, and the floors everything is screaming…why? They have never experienced such ‘squeaky clean’ scrubbing ever. Everywhere … What is happening? For the past 3 weeks everyone has been at home. Something in town…Corona Virus! Run! <br /><br /> The sink: <em>‘I am constantly wet’.</em> (Everyone is washing their hands). I can see one person about 15 times in a day. My assistant (liquid soap) does not last anymore for up to 2 days.<br /><br /> The Mirror: I am not lacking faces anymore. (Those washing their hands have been admiring themselves)<br /><br /> The Door: The elbow has become my new love. (Everyone tries to open with the elbow.) <br /><br />The floor: I get to be swept and scrubbed daily. My new perfume is bleach! <br /><br />My dear students, <br /><br />The situation we find ourselves in, has been highly unprecedented. We are shocked, the whole world has been taken unawares. And we find that in such situations, we don’t know how to react. There are many ways one can react: ‘fear, learn or grow…’ <br /><br /> We have chosen to act, we want to… <br /><br />At this period too, the fear of the effects of the pandemic, including reduced supply of our basic needs for the day make it more worrisome.  <br /><br />But what do we do? Where do we go from here?<br /><br /> It is very tough for you and for most of us. And now, we need to do our classes online! Technology use comes with its varying challenges: not having adequate mobile devices to download the appropriate app, insufficient power supply with reduced battery power of our devices, and the increasing cost of data! Name it!….<br /><br /> Can we make the most of our situation? We decided at the point of the lockdown that we would start classes online if ‘stay home’ continues. We agreed to use the most accessible means for many of us for classroom teaching and learning. However, as the day goes by we realise that the challenges get rougher. And we don’t know, what can we do?<br /><br /> While we work and pray for the best…Do you know you can save your data and your battery life? Here are a few tricks I use:<br /><br /> Keep a timetable and keep busy in the house. Have time to clean, study, be on the phone, watch movie, go to bed etc. When you engage in many activities, you would not be ‘hooked’ on your phone.Switch off phones when not in use for a long time. For example when going to bed. <br /><br /><ul><li>Put your phone settings so that it does not automatically download media. You download the ones you believe are of interest to you. As you know, your contacts send many things on Whatsapp and some are repeated in groups.</li><li> Set your Whatsapp messages to ‘silent’, your phone will not beep all the time message comes in.</li><li> Switch on your data at a fixed time when you plan to be online or to check and reply messages.</li><li> If you are working with a laptop, try to work offline most of the time and then copy and paste your work when you are ready to reply or send email for example. Switch off apps that run or update automatically once you are connected to internet.</li><li> You may want to exit from Whatsapp groups that do not add much value to you. Evade clicking on all messages on the group especially if you are aware that the sender usually sends unimportant messages. </li><li>Limit sending videos and making video calls. Use messages to fix appointment for when you want to call or to be called.</li><li> Plan your social media presence especially on Facebook.<b>Must I like all selfie photos… </b> NO! </ul><br /> <br /> Back to our letter… <br /> <br /> What can I learn today outside school work? I won’t go to bed unless I learn something ‘new’…’ Let’s grow on the inside…’ like St. Josemaria advises. ‘If I make it out of this period what account do I give to myself, to others and God of making use of the talents I have…’ Creativity, initiative within the limits of the so little I have left…. This is part of Hospitality… remember…Wavecrest! …Discover Hospitality… <br />What can I do for someone today? <br /><br /><em> ‘I will pray and see how…’ </em>Yes, that’s the spirit… <br /><br />We can …God help us! 😀 <br /><br /> Nwabachili, 16-04-2020 <br /><br />p.s. I plan to learn to use the lawnmower today as the gardener has not been at work, and the grass is almost seeming like short trees.  I am afraid ‘creepy crawly’ may soon become a friend to the compound! I would see if I send you a photo when I start using it.",
